# md-encyclopedia-profiles
The Encyclopedia Profiles project is where you will find detailed information on just about everyone in the web and mobile development and programming communities, including the architects of the web, the authors of programming books, ordinary developers like us, creators of open-source projects, and others. This is somewhat similar to Wikipedia’s entries for famous people, except that on Encyclopedia Profiles, you will find people already famous in the web and mobile programming communities, as well as not-yet-famous people and don’t-want-to-be-famous people.
